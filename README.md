# BrosFlix - Movie Information App
BrosFlix is an Android application developed using Java and Android Studio that allows users to explore and view information about movies. The app leverages The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch and display details about various films. This README provides an overview of the project structure, key components, and functionality.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several components, including XML layout files, Java classes, and resources. Here's a brief overview of the main folders:

### res (Resources): Contains layout files, images, and string values used in the user interface.
### com.example.myapplication (Main Package): Houses the primary Java classes for the application.
Key Components
### 1. MainActivity.java
The MainActivity class is the main activity of the application. It handles the initialization of views, loading data from the TMDb API, and managing user interactions such as searching and changing the layout of the RecyclerView. Additionally, it facilitates changing the movie category.

### 2. Adaptery.java
Adaptery is a custom adapter for the RecyclerView, allowing users to switch between a list and grid view. It is responsible for loading data into views and managing click events.

### 3. MovieDetailActivity.java
The MovieDetailActivity class displays detailed information about a selected movie, including its title, release date, popularity, and synopsis. It utilizes the Glide library to efficiently load images from URLs.

### 4. MovieModelClass.java
MovieModelClass represents the data model for storing information about a movie, including its ID, name, image, release date, popularity, and synopsis.

### 5. SpacesItemDecoration.java
SpacesItemDecoration is a RecyclerView item decoration class that provides spacing between elements in the RecyclerView.

## XML Layouts
### activity_main.xml: Defines the main activity's interface, including a RecyclerView for displaying movies, a SearchView for searching, and a Switch for changing between list and grid views. It also features a Spinner for selecting the movie category.

### movie_detail.xml: Defines the layout for the MovieDetailActivity, displaying specific details of a selected movie, such as title, release date, popularity, and synopsis. It includes an ImageView for showing the movie poster.

### movie_item.xml: Describes the appearance of an item in the RecyclerView's list view, showing the title, release date, popularity, and movie image.

### grid_layout.xml: Similar to movie_item.xml but tailored for a grid layout in the RecyclerView.

### menu_main.xml: Defines the application menu with three options: "Top Rated," "Most Popular," and "Upcoming Releases." These options allow users to change the displayed movie category.
